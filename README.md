HTTP/2 Attack Vector Testing Tool

**Description:**

This program serves as a template for testing the HTTP/2 protocol against various attack vectors, including denial-of-service (rapid reset), desynchronization, and other potential vulnerabilities.

The motivation behind developing this tool stems from the personal experience of facing time constraints in locating relevant code sources when dealing with HTTP/2-related issues.

**Key Points:**

- The code has been carefully stripped of any references to a private bug bounty program to maintain confidentiality.
- Users are responsible for modifying the provided values to align with their specific testing objectives.
- The program offers granular control over various parameters, including:
    - Randomizing actions such as GET and POST method orchestration
    - User-agent selection
    - Thread management
    - Window size
    - Maximum requests
    - Maximum concurrent streams
    - Maximum frame size
    - Target host and path
